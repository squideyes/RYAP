                    While visiting my family at Christmas, my ten year-old nephew, Parker, told me my very
                    first "Pirate Joke."  Needless to say, the two of us laughed ourselves silly at the punch line.

                    Back home in New York City I shared the joke with my friend, David, over New Year's Brunch. 
                    He likewise laughed himself silly, but more to the point, the two of us couldn't help but riff 
                    upon the theme.

                I managed to write a couple of those jokes down but the whole thing shifted into high gear when I had 
                the dubious honor of driving a fifteen foot truck with all of my worldly posessions from NYC to St. Louis.  
                For the uniformed, US 70W doesn't have much in the way of interesting scenery, so to keep myself occupied 
                during the trek I decided to write down as many pirate jokes as I could.  This website is a compendium of 
                some of those.

                I trust that some of the following will make you laugh. BTW, if you have any pirate jokes of your own,
