                    While visiting my family at Christmas, my six year-old nephew, Parker, asked me
                    "<b>How does a pirate go on vacation?</b>"
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had no idea, of course, but I was delighted to learn he did so "<b>In an R-V!</b>"  
                    Needless to say, we laughed ourselves silly, scowling like scurvy pirates while 
                    stretching out our "R-'s"in true pirate fashion. "Shiver me timbers, matey."  AARRRRRRGH!

                Back home in NYC I shared the joke with my husband's best friend, David, over New Year's
                Brunch. Giggling like fiends, the two of us couldn't help but riff upon the theme for 
                hours. I managed to write a couple of those jokes down but things shifted into high 
                gear when I had the dubious honor of driving a fifteen foot truck with all of my worldly 
                posessions from NYC to St. Louis. For the uniformed, US 70W doesn't offer much in the
                way of scenery, so to keep myself occupied during the trek I decided to write down as 
                many pirate jokes as I could.  This website is a compendium of some of those.

                The following compendium is simply more of the same, so do enjoy.  Also, If you have any 
                pirate jokes of your own, be sure to click on this <a href="Contribute">Contribute</a> link to share them.
